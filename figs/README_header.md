SWECO25 is Swiss-wide raster database at 25-meter resolution for ecological research in Switzerland gathering 5,265 layers from 10 main environmental categories. SWECO25 layers were standardized to a common spatial grid covering all of Switzerland, so they all share the same spatial resolution, extent, and geographic coordinate system. SWECO25 includes both the standardized source data and newly calculated layers, such as those obtained by computing focal or distance statistics.

The [detailed list](https://github.com/NKulling/SWECO25/blob/main/data/SWECO25_datalayers_details.csv) of every layer present in SWECO25 is available in this repository. The SWECO25 database is openly available on Zenodo and is intended to be improved, updated, and extended at regular intervals.
